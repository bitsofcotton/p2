# p2
Generic predictor corrector with random. This suppose the random stream we make is better than original random source and the one we made is a little predictable with some prediction method. If so, this slices a little amount of random entropy. This is because short length of original prediction method divides 3 parts, bet ok, bet ng, or no bet. So with blending no periodical datas, it flatten 33%, 33%, 33% of them.

# How to use
Change p2.py getrand functions and pp subprocess initializer.
