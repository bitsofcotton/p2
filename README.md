    # once we code and upload here also someone observed our code as a optimization, the jammer intension can affects us also this causes the universal invariant we made hypothesis slips if we don't make any of the input stream something hypothesis grips.
    # so we're trying to make hypothesis it's sectional one also they worked well for now but might not after this upload.
