# ./catgp default uses 4 status dimension.
# it is needed 2 dimension and complement some, but to complement, 4 is needed.
# so predict 4 times causes no status dimension, then, last one predicts.
# but to do so, the accuracy we need is large because subtract invariant
# causes far from y=0 line, so float operator +/- should use large accuracy.
